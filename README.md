# Valkiryn is going to be a website for japanese learners
This dynamic website built in PHP by Rynik Studio will provide vocabulary, kanji and grammar lessons to learners
There will also be many diverse exercices that range from kanji drawing, sentences building, oral comprehension
The idea is to improve on the general idea of duolingo to make it more viable for learners.

During this project I'll use the following languages/frameworks:
-HTML5/CSS3
-PHP
-Javascript
-Typescript
-NodeJS
-VueJS
